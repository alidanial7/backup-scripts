## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL server
- Bash shell environment
- Basic understanding of PostgreSQL administration
- Sufficient disk space for backups

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/backup-scripts.git
cd backup-scripts/postgresql
```

2. Choose the appropriate backup solution for your deployment:
   - For Docker-based PostgreSQL: See `docker/README.md`
   - For traditional installations: See respective solution documentation

## 🔧 Configuration

Each backup solution has its own configuration requirements. Please refer to the specific solution's documentation for detailed configuration instructions.

## 📊 Backup Management

### Backup Files

- Backups are stored in solution-specific directories
- Files are typically named with timestamp: `backup_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.sql.gz`
- Compressed using gzip for efficient storage

### Logs

- Detailed logs are stored in solution-specific log directories
- Each backup operation creates a new log file
- Logs include success/failure status and error messages

## 🔄 Restoring Backups

Restoration procedures may vary depending on the backup solution used. Please refer to the specific solution's documentation for detailed restoration instructions.

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- Backup files are stored with restricted permissions
- Sensitive configuration is stored in environment files (git-ignored)
- Logs don't contain sensitive information
- Regular security audits recommended
